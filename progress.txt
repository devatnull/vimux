## Codebase Patterns
- Simulator types live in src/lib/simulator/types.ts
- Factory functions for default state in src/lib/simulator/constants.ts
- Export all from index.ts for clean imports
- Use `npm run build` for typecheck (includes TypeScript checking)
- Pre-existing lint errors in page.tsx and components exist; ignore them

- Implemented comprehensive type definitions for tmux and vim state
- Created src/lib/simulator/types.ts with:
  - VimMode, VimOperator, SearchDirection, FindMotion types
  - VimBuffer with marks, folds, undo/redo stacks, cursor position
  - VimState with registers (named, numbered, special), macros, jumplist, changelist, search state
  - TmuxPane with dimensions, content, scrollback, zoom state
  - TmuxWindow with panes, layout types
  - TmuxSession with windows, attached state
  - TmuxState with copy mode, prefix state, paste buffer
  - SimulatorState combining tmux and vim
- Created src/lib/simulator/constants.ts with:
  - Default settings (VimSettings)
  - Factory functions for buffers, panes, windows, sessions
  - Bracket pairs, word separators, special keys mappings
- Created src/lib/simulator/index.ts for exports
- Files changed: 3 new files in src/lib/simulator/
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing types.ts in src/lib/ has older/simpler definitions - new simulator types are more comprehensive
  - Use createDefaultSimulatorState() to initialize full state
  - VimRegisterContent has type property ("char" | "line" | "block") for paste behavior
