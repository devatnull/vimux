## Codebase Patterns
- Simulator types live in src/lib/simulator/types.ts
- Factory functions for default state in src/lib/simulator/constants.ts
- Export all from index.ts for clean imports
- Use `npm run build` for typecheck (includes TypeScript checking)
- Pre-existing lint errors in page.tsx and components exist; ignore them

- Implemented comprehensive type definitions for tmux and vim state
- Created src/lib/simulator/types.ts with:
  - VimMode, VimOperator, SearchDirection, FindMotion types
  - VimBuffer with marks, folds, undo/redo stacks, cursor position
  - VimState with registers (named, numbered, special), macros, jumplist, changelist, search state
  - TmuxPane with dimensions, content, scrollback, zoom state
  - TmuxWindow with panes, layout types
  - TmuxSession with windows, attached state
  - TmuxState with copy mode, prefix state, paste buffer
  - SimulatorState combining tmux and vim
- Created src/lib/simulator/constants.ts with:
  - Default settings (VimSettings)
  - Factory functions for buffers, panes, windows, sessions
  - Bracket pairs, word separators, special keys mappings
- Created src/lib/simulator/index.ts for exports
- Files changed: 3 new files in src/lib/simulator/
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing types.ts in src/lib/ has older/simpler definitions - new simulator types are more comprehensive
  - Use createDefaultSimulatorState() to initialize full state
  - VimRegisterContent has type property ("char" | "line" | "block") for paste behavior

- Implemented complete vim motion engine for basic motions
- Created src/lib/simulator/vim/motions.ts with:
  - h/j/k/l character and line movement with boundary checking
  - w/W word/WORD forward motions (word = alphanumeric, WORD = whitespace-delimited)
  - b/B word/WORD backward motions
  - e/E end of word/WORD motions
  - 0/^/$ line position motions (start, first non-whitespace, end)
  - gg/G go to line motions (with optional count)
  - {/} paragraph motions (blank line separated)
  - f/F/t/T character find motions (forward/backward, on/before)
  - ;/, repeat last find motion (same/reverse direction)
  - All motions support count prefix
- Created src/lib/simulator/vim/index.ts for exports
- Updated src/lib/simulator/index.ts to export vim module
- Files changed: 3 files
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Motion functions return MotionResult with optional linewise/inclusive flags for operator integration
  - lastFindMotion state tracks f/F/t/T for ; and , repetition
  - Word boundaries use WORD_SEPARATORS constant from constants.ts
  - executeMotion() is the main entry point for applying motions with count support

- Implemented advanced vim motions in src/lib/simulator/vim/motions.ts:
  - % (motionPercent): Bracket matching for ()[]{}
  - [[ and ]] (motionDoubleBracketBackward/Forward): Jump to function/class definitions
  - [] and ][ (motionBracketEndBackward/Forward): Jump to closing braces
  - H/M/L (motionH_screen/M_screen/L_screen): Screen-relative line navigation
  - Ctrl-d/Ctrl-u (motionCtrlD/CtrlU): Half-page scrolling with ScrollResult type
  - Ctrl-f/Ctrl-b (motionCtrlF/CtrlB): Full-page scrolling
  - n/N (motionSearchNext/Prev): Repeat search forward/backward using searchState
  - ' and ` (motionMarkLine/MarkExact): Mark navigation (line vs exact position)
  - '' (motionPreviousPosition): Jump to previous position
  - Ctrl-o/Ctrl-i (motionCtrlO/CtrlI): Jumplist navigation with position tracking
  - gi (motionGI): Go to last insert position
  - gd (motionGD): Go to local declaration (first occurrence of word)
  - * and # (motionStar/Hash): Search word under cursor forward/backward
- Added addToJumplist() helper function for jumplist management
- Extended executeMotion() switch statement with all new motion keys
- Files changed: src/lib/simulator/vim/motions.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ScrollResult extends MotionResult with scrollOffset for viewport management
  - Screen motions (H/M/L, Ctrl-d/u/f/b) need visibleStartLine/visibleEndLine from the UI
  - Mark navigation uses buffer.marks for local (a-z) and state.globalMarks for global (A-Z)
  - Star/Hash motions return both result and pattern for search highlighting
  - Jumplist has max 100 entries; managed via addToJumplist helper
